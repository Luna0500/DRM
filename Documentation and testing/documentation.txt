In our project documentation, we crafted use cases for every function within our website, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of system functionalities.
Each use case delves into preconditions, normal conditions, and postconditions, contributing the operational flow of the system. 
By detailing prerequisites, expected processes, and outcomes, we establish clarity for developers. 
Additionally, our documentation includes a detailed depiction of the physical process model, encapsulating the operational flow within the system. 
There's also the physical data model, outlining the structural organization of the database system.

On the user end, we aimed to enhance user experience by facilitating informed decision-making. 
To achieve this, we integrated a user-friendly table, aiding users in assessing the condition of their card. 
This table serves as a practical tool, empowering users to make informed choices tailored to their specific needs and circumstances.
